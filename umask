Q> 
Set the permission
    a) All new creating files for user natasha as -r--------- as default permission
    b) All new creating directories for user natasha as dr-x------ as default permission


A>
Directory default umask: 777
Files default umask: 666  

First thing switch to user natasha and check the umask which is 0022

We need to make the permanent changes in .bash_profile file which is present in /home/natasha
vi .bash_profile

umask 277

Now source it and check umask again: source .bash_profile which is 0277


To verify: Make 1 file and directory and check its permission
