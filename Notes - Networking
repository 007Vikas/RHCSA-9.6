Verify Network Configuration

ip a                    # verify IP address
ping -c 3 192.168.1.1   # check gateway
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8       # check Internet
ping -c 3 google.com    # check DNS


Configure Hostname

hostnamectl set-hostname server1.example.com




What is a zone in firewalld?

In firewalld, a zone is like a security level or trust level for your network connections.
A zone in firewalld is a set of rules that determine the level of trust you have in the network you're connected to.
Different zones allow or block different services, ports, and connections.

Examples of Zones (from most strict to least strict):
Zone	                      Trust Level	                                              What it means
drop	                      üî¥ Very strict	                                          All incoming connections are dropped.
block	                      üõë Strict                                               	All incoming are rejected with a message.
public	                    üö´ Semi-secure	                                          For use in public areas. Limited services allowed.
home	                      üè† Trusted	                                              For your home LAN. More services are allowed.
internal	                  üè¢ Office                                                 LAN	Similar to home, used inside companies.
trusted	                    ‚úÖ Fully open	                                          All incoming connections are accepted.



How does firewalld use zones?

Each network interface (like eth0 or ens33) is assigned a zone. You then allow or deny services/ports in each zone.

Check the current zone of the interface: firewall-cmd --get-zone-of-interface=eth0

List allowed services in a zone: firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services

Change default zone: firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=home
